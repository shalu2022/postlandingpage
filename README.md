# Postlandingpage

This project uses API (jsonplaceholder) for calling posts data. 

Using seach box we can filter the perticular post.

Also there is seperate landing page for each post which contains an image(currently using another API data from jsonplaceholder) and the title of the post.

Lastly it contians the pagination at the bottom 

P.S. For style : Bootstrap is used
